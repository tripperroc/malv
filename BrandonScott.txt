I have implemented the group selection with a selection box to move around multiple states at once.  

In the real program I'm assuming they'll want to add another button with the hand symbol or something to
attach this to, but for now it works when the transition button is selected.

With the transition button selected, click and drag on the canvas to draw a selection rectangle around
as many states as desired.  This will bold the selected states.  Then you move one of these states as
before (by selecting the state button, clicking and dragging the state), and all of the other selected
states will follow it maintaining their relative positions to one another.
