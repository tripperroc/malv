We implemented modifying the spline size of a transition.
To use this feature, make sure you have the circle tool selected,
then click on a state. Then, click on the transition that you want
to change. Now, with the transition selected (the transition letter
should be blue) press the up and down arrow keys to incrementally 
adjust the size of the spline.

KNOWN DEFECT:
The transition letter and arrow are not always aligned well with the
transition at extreme angles.
